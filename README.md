# Clustering&Dimension_Reduction

### Application of PCA and K-means algorithms using R on FIFA19 data set.

The aim of this work was to apply unsupervised machine learning methods to analyse player statistics data in FIFA 19. The first step was be to reduce the dimensionality
of the data set while keeping as much information as possible, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The reduced data set has been divided into groups using k-means algorithm. Finally, the results have been be analysed and compared to the original groupings.
